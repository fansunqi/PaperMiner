    "abstract": "We discuss our transient search for directed energy systems in local galaxies, with calculations indi- cating the ability of modest searches to detect optical Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) sources in the closest galaxies. Our analysis follows Lubin (2016) where a messenger civilization follows a beacon strategy we call \u201cintelligent targeting.\u201d We plot the required laser time to achieve an SNR of 10 and find the time for a blind transmission to target all stars in the Milky Way to be achievable for local galactic civilizations. As high cadence and sky coverage is the pathway to enable such a detection, we operate the Local Galactic Transient Survey (LGTS) targeting M31 (the Andromeda Galaxy), the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) via Las Cumbres Observa- tory\u2019s (LCO) network of 0.4 m telescopes. We explore the ability of modest searches like the LGTS to detect directed pulses in optical and near-infrared wavelengths from Extraterrestrial Intelligence (ETI) at these distances and conclude a civilization utilizing less powerful laser technology than we can construct in this century is readily detectable with the LGTS\u2019s observational capabilities. Data processing of 30,000 LGTS images spanning 5 years is in progress with the TRansient Image Processing Pipeline (TRIPP; Thomas et al. (2025)). Keywords: SETI, Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence, Laser Optics, Phased Arrays 1. INTRODUCTION The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) seeks to discover extraterrestrial communications based on our understanding of terrestrial technologies and poten- tial future capabilities. Originally, this search focused on radio frequencies, which were well understood as means of communication when SETI efforts began in the 1960s (Tarter (2001)). However, within a year of the discov- ery of lasers, Schwartz & Townes (1961) proposed beam- like signals in optical wavelengths as a means of inter- stellar communication. Indeed, the continually growing power output of laser technology in recent decades sug- gests that lasers may be an effective means of interstellar communication (Howard et al. (2004); Townes (1983)). agthomas@ucsb.edu Thus, examining optical and near-infrared frequencies for laser communications, which few SETI searches have examined (Hippke (2018) and Price et al. (2020)) is a natural extension of SETI efforts. Optical SETI (OSETI) initially focused on systems designed to observe individual stars and detect transient phenomena, such as brief, nanosecond-scale laser pulses, which could indicate technosignals (Beskin et al. (1995); Wright et al. (2001); Howard et al. (2004); Maire et al. (2016)). However, as the likelihood of any given star hosting detectable ETI is small, and since technosignals may not originate from around stars, wide sky coverage is essential to boost the probability of a detection. The first wide-field OSETI survey was the Har- vard/Planetary Society all-sky search which used a 1.8 m optical telescope imaging a 1.6\u00b0 \u00d7 0.2\u00b0 field of view at Oak Ridge Observatory (Howard et al. (2007)). Since arXiv:2501.18903v1 [astro-ph.IM] 31 Jan 2025"

    "abstract": "Magnetic hysteresis properties in Fe/Si multilayers have been studied as a function of the B4C content to control magnetization amplitude, coercivity, and hysteresis tilt, properties that are beneficial to tune for advancing applications in e.g. data storage, spintronics, and sensors. With an ion-assisted magnetron sputtering technique, 35 distinct thin film multilayer samples were prepared and their magnetic and structural properties were characterized by vibrating sample magnetometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and X-ray and neutron scattering methods. Key findings indicate that adding B4C lowers the coercivity and can decrease the saturation magnetization, demonstrating the tunability of magnetic responses based on composition. For samples with \uf04c=30\u00c5 periodicity, 10-15% of B4C addition produces antiferromagnetically (AF) coupled multilayers, and such AF coupling strength increases with the B4C content. Our findings reveal that B atoms do not chemically bind within the Fe atoms but instead occupy interstitial positions, disrupting medium- to long-range crystallinity thereby inducing the amorphization. Thereon, the observed effects on magnetic properties are directly attributed to this amorphization process caused by the presence of B\u2084C. The demonstrated ability to finely adjust magnetic properties by varying the B4C content offers a promising approach to overcome challenges in magnetic device performance and efficiency. INTRODUCTION Measuring the magnetic hysteresis curve is a fundamental tool for analyzing the magnetic properties of materials, including thin films,1\u20133 as it graphically represents the relationship between the applied magnetic field (H) and the induced magnetization (M).

    "abstract": "Conventional predictive modeling of parametric relationships in manufacturing processes is limited by the subjectivity of human expertise and intuition on the one hand and by the cost and time of experimental data generation on the other hand. This work addresses this issue by establishing a new Large Language Model (LLM) framework. The novelty lies in combining automatic extraction of process-relevant knowledge embedded in the literature with iterative model refinement based on a small amount of experimental data. This approach is evaluated on three distinct manufacturing processes that are based on machining, deformation, and additive principles. The results show that for the same small experimental data budget the models derived by our framework have unexpectedly high extrapolative performance, often surpassing the capabilities of conventional Machine Learning. Further, our approach eliminates manual generation of initial models or expertise-dependent interpretation of the literature. The results also reveal the importance of the nature of the knowledge extracted from the literature and the significance of both the knowledge extraction and model refinement components. Keywords: Manufacturing Process Modeling; Large Language Model; Retrieval-Augmented Generation; Iterative Model Refinement. 1. Introduction Modeling of parametric relationships, i.e., the linkage between process parameters and performance metrics of the process or the product, is critical for control of manufacturing processes. The creation of physics- based simulations for deriving such relationships is often difficult and time-intensive (especially for novel processes) due to incomplete understanding of the underlying multiphysical multidomain interactions and associated constitutive laws. For example, existing models cannot predict the part-scale distribution of grain and void characteristics in electrically-assisted incremental forming of sheet metal due to a lack of models that can capture the non-equilibrium multiaxial thermomechanical conditions imposed on the metal (Bao et al., 2015; Chang et al., 2021; Huang & Log\u00e9, 2016; Shrivastava & Tandon, 2019). Similarly, the ICME Virtual Aluminum Castings (Allison et al., 2006) required models created iteratively across decades before being fully operational. It can also be difficult to construct physics-based models at the appropriate length and time scales. For example, such models can predict post-print sintering in Binder-jet printing on the few- particles scale (Fuchs et al., 2022; Grant et al., 2023; Mao et al., 2023; Mostafaei et al., 2021; Paudel et al., 2021; Sadeghi Borujeni et al., 2022) but cannot capture the part-scale spatial distribution of grain size, voids, cracking, and surface finish for complex geometries. Similarly, linking the nanoscale optical intensification between nanoparticle pairs to part-scale thermal modeling for millions of nanoparticles in printed circuits requires a scaling law, the formulation of which has taken many years and is still incomplete (Cleeman et al., 2022; Devaraj et al., 2020; Devaraj & Malhotra, 2019; Devaraj et al., 2021; Jahangir et al., 2020). The creation of such physics-based models is also affected by subjective interpretations of literature by the"

    "abstract": "Nearly-doubly-regular tournaments have played signi\ufb01cant roles in extremal graph theory. In this note, we determine all possible cyclotomic nearly-doubly-regular tournaments and their spec- trum. Furthermore, under the celebrated Hardy-Littlewood conjecture F in analytic number the- ory, our results con\ufb01rm the conjecture due to Sergey Savchenko (J. Graph Theory 83 (2016), 44\u201377) on the existence of in\ufb01nitely many nearly-doubly-regular tournaments with the canonical spectrum. 1 Introduction A tournament is an orientation of a complete graph. A tournament with n vertices is said to be regular if n is odd and out-degree of each vertex is (n \u22121)/2. For even n, a tournament with n vertices is said to be near-regular if out-degree of each vertex is equal to n/2 or n/2 \u22121. A regular tournament with n vertices is a doubly-regular tournament, denoted by DRn, if n \u22613 (mod 4) and in- and out-neighbors of each vertex induce regular tournaments. Similarly, a regular tournament with n vertices is a nearly- doubly-regular tournament, denoted by NDRn, if n \u22611 (mod 4) and in- and out-neighbors of each vertex induce near-regular tournaments. Doubly-regular and near-doubly-regular tournaments play key roles in many branches of extremal graph theory such as the counting problem for cycles of a given length in tournaments (see e.g. [1], [4], [8], [11], [19], [20], [21], [22]). Indeed it is known that those minimizes the number of 4-cycles and maximizes the number of 5-cycles among regular tournaments ( [1], [19]). Furthermore, combining Theorem 5 in [1] and Theorem 1 in [6], it is readily seen that these tournaments posses quasi-randomness (see also [14], [17], [18]). Hence constructing doubly-regular or nearly-doubly-regular tournaments is an interesting but challenging open problem. In particular, there is only few known constructions for nearly-doubly-regular tournaments while more constructions are known for doubly-regular tournaments (see e.g. [25], [17]). In this note, we focus on cyclotomic tournaments introduced by Asti\u00b4e-Vidal [2]. For a prime power q, let Fq denote the \ufb01nite \ufb01eld of order q and let F+ q and F\u2217 q = Fq \\ {0} be the additive and multiplicative groups of Fq, respectively. Let g be a primitive element of Fq, that is, a generator of F\u2217 q and C(2\u2113) 0 denote the subgroup of F\u2217 q of index 2\u2113. If q \u22121 = 2\u2113m, where \u2113\u22651 and m is odd, then the cyclotomic tournament CTq with q vertices is de\ufb01ned as the tournament with vertex set Fq in which there exists an arc from x to y if and only if x \u2212y \u2208C(2\u2113) 0 \u222agC(2\u2113) 0 \u222a\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222ag2\u2113\u22121\u22121C(2\u2113) 0 . This is well-de\ufb01ned since (D, \u2212D) is a partition of F\u2217 q where D = C(2\u2113) 0 \u222agC(2\u2113) 0 \u222a\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222ag2\u2113\u22121\u22121C(2\u2113) 0 and \u2212D = {\u2212d | d \u2208D}. Note that if \u2113= 1, or equivalently, q \u22613 (mod 4), then CTq is exactly the Paley tournament (a.k.a. quadratic residue tournament) with q vertices. On the other hand, it has been conjectured ( [3], [19]) that there exist in\ufb01nitely many primes p \u22615 (mod 8) such that CTp is nearly-doubly-regular while the authors of [3] and [24] veri\ufb01ed that CTp is nearly-doubly-regular when p = 5, 13, 29, 53, 173, 229, 293, 733 by computer search. \u2217Research and Education Institute for Semiconductors and Informatics, Kumamoto University 2-39-1, Kurokami, Chuo, Kumamoto, 860-8555, Japan.

We show that for every d \u22653 there exist infinitely many mutually rigid d-regular graphs of arbitrary odd girth g \u22657. Moreover, we determine the minimum order of a rigid d-regular graph for every d \u22653. This provides strong positive answers to a question of van der Zypen [https://mathoverflow.net/q/296483, https://mathoverflow.net/q/ 321108]. Further, we use our construction to show that every finite monoid is iso- morphic to the endomorphism monoid of a regular graph. This solves a problem of Babai and Pultr [J. Comb. Theory, Ser. B, 1980]. Mathematics Subject Classifications: 05C25,20M30,05C75,05C60 Keywords: graph endomorphisms, monoids, rigidity, regular graphs 1 Introduction All graphs, groups, and monoids are considered to be finite. Frucht [8] shows that every group is isomorphic to the automorphism group Aut(G) of a graph G. Later, Hedrl\u00b4\u0131n and Pultr [13,14] show that every monoid M is isomorphic to the endomorphism monoid End(G) of a graph G. It is a natural and well-studied question what further assumptions can be made about G, while maintaining the above theorems valid, see the introduction of [20]. Here, we focus on G being regular. It is another classic result of Frucht [9] that every group is isomorphic to the automor- phism group Aut(G) of a 3-regular graph G (even of a Hamiltonian 3-regular G, see [3]). Soon after, Sabidussi [27] showed that every group is isomorphic to the automorphism group Aut(G) of a d-regular graph G for every d \u22653. In particular, this applies to the trivial group {e}, i.e., there are d-regular asymmetric graphs for every d \u22653. Izbicki [19] shows that for every d \u22653 there exist infinitely many d-regular asymmetric graphs and Baron and Imrich [5] completely determine the function \u00b5(d) that assigns to every d \u22653 the smallest order of an asymmetric d-regular graph.

    "abstract": "In recent years, significant efforts have been di- rected toward adapting modern neural network architectures for tabular data. However, despite their larger number of parameters and longer train- ing and inference times, these models often fail to consistently outperform vanilla multilayer per- ceptron (MLP) neural networks. Moreover, MLP- based ensembles have recently demonstrated su- perior performance and efficiency compared to ad- vanced deep learning methods. Therefore, rather than focusing on building deeper and more com- plex deep learning models, we propose investi- gating whether MLP neural networks can be re- placed with more efficient architectures without sacrificing performance. In this paper, we first introduce GG MoE, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) model with a Gumbel-Softmax gating function. We then demonstrate that GG MoE with an em- bedding layer achieves the highest performance across 38 datasets compared to standard MoE and MLP models. Finally, we show that both MoE and GG MoE utilize significantly fewer parameters than MLPs, making them a promising alternative for scaling and ensemble methods. 1. Introduction Supervised machine learning on tabular data is widely ap- plied, and its business value is undeniable, leading to the development of numerous algorithms to address these prob- lems. Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) models (Chen & Guestrin, 2016; Ke et al., 2017; Prokhorenkova et al., 2018) have demonstrated superior performance com- pared to deep learning methods (Shwartz-Ziv & Armon, 2022; Grinsztajn et al., 2022) and remain the most common and natural choice for tabular data prediction. As a result, tabular data remains one of the few domains where neural networks do not yet dominate. In recent years, many researchers have attempted to adapt 1Independent Researcher. Correspondence to: Andrei Chernov <chernov.andrey.998@gmail.com>. transformer-based neural network architectures for tabu- lar data (Huang et al., 2020; Somepalli et al., 2021; Song et al., 2019). While these approaches have shown promising results on specific subsets of datasets, they often fail to con- sistently outperform vanilla Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks across a wide range of datasets (Gorishniy et al., 2024). This is despite their significantly higher com- putational requirements and larger number of parameters. Furthermore, a study (Gorishniy et al., 2024) demonstrated that efficient ensembles of MLPs tend to outperform ad- vanced deep learning models. This raises a question that, in our view, has been overlooked in recent research: Is there a neural network architecture that is more efficient than MLPs in terms of parameter count while still achieving comparable performance? Framing the problem this way makes investigating the per- formance of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models on tabular data a natural choice. MoE has recently gained popularity in deep learning (Fedus et al., 2022). However, to the best of our knowledge, little research has explored the adaptation of MoE to the tabular deep learning domain or evaluated its performance across a broad range of datasets. In this paper, we aim to address this gap. Additionally, we introduce MoE with a Gumbel-Softmax activation function on the output of the gating network (GG MoE); see Section 3.4 for details. We compare the perfor- mance of MoE and GG MoE with MLP across 38 datasets and demonstrate that GG MoE achieves the highest average performance while both MoE and GG MoE are significantly more parameter-efficient than MLP. 2. Related Work 2.1. Tabular Deep Learning Although it is theoretically proven that feedforward neural networks can approximate functions from a wide family with arbitrary accuracy (Cybenko, 1989; Hornik, 1991), in practice, they often underperform compared to GBDT meth- ods in the tabular domain (Gorishniy et al., 2021; Shwartz- Ziv & Armon, 2022; Grinsztajn et al., 2022). To improve performance, extensive research has been conducted. Here, we highlight three main directions. 1 arXiv:2502.03608v1 [cs.LG] 5 Feb 2025"

    "abstract": "Our def- initions are applicable to any quantum system, continuous or discrete. To illustrate their utility, we derive upper and lower bounds on time-separated correlation functions, akin to the bound on spatially separated correlators in terms of the mutual information. In certain cases our bounds are tight. For relativistic quantum field theories our definition agrees with the analytic continuation from spacelike to timelike separated regions. We provide relevant measurement protocols and exe- cute them on the IBM quantum device ibm sherbrooke for a simple qubit system. Also we perform explicit computations for an Ising spin chain, free fermions, (1+1)-dimensional conformal field the- ories and holographic theories. Finally we explain how the proposed entanglement in time provides a microscopic definition for the recently introduced timelike pseudoentropy. I. INTRODUCTION Entanglement is a key property of quantum mechanics. Its applications range from classifying topological phases [1] to quantifying the black hole information paradox [2]. However, entanglement is a property of a given state; it is not sensitive to what happened to the system in the past. Generalizing the notion of entanglement to include information about time evolution could open a new win- dow into probing the dynamics of quantum systems with many potential applications. Guided by relativistic quantum field theory (RQFT), where space and time are intimately related, we pro- pose a definition of \u201centanglement in time\u201d applicable to any quantum system, continuous or discrete. Central to our construction is a generalization of the density matrix suited for characterizing the properties of timelike sep- arated subsystems. We prove various properties of our \u201ctimelike density matrix\u201d which are analogous to prop- erties of the conventional \u201cspacelike\u201d density matrix. To illustrate the utility of our construction, we use it to derive upper and lower bounds on dynamical (Wight- man) correlation functions. We show that a certain mea- sure of entanglement in time for two subsystems, which we call the entanglement imagitivity, is nonzero if and only if one subsystem can influence the other at a later time. We also provide experimentally feasible protocols for measuring entanglement in time. II. DEFINING ENTANGLEMENT IN TIME To motivate our construction, consider in an RQFT the von Neumann entanglement entropy \u2212Tr \u03c1AB log \u03c1AB or Tsallis entropy Tr(\u03c1n AB) (exponentiated R\u00b4enyi entropy) of two spatially separated regions A and B; see Figure 1 (a). These are analytic functions (possibly with poles and branch-cuts) of spacetime coordinates defining A and B, \u2217milekhin@caltech.edu Figure 1. (a) Here A, B are spacelike separated. There are many existing tools in RQFT to compute Tr \u03c1n AB. (b) Time- like separated A, B. In RQFT this configuration can be con- tinuously deformed to (a). which are explicitly known in some cases. Now we can ask: if we analytically continue the answer for Tr(\u03c1n AB) from spacelike separation to timelike separation as in Fig- ure 1(b), can we give it any quantum-mechanical inter- pretation? For example, in a (1+1)-dimensional confor- mal field theory (CFT), the aforementioned analytic con- tinuation simply means computing time-separated corre- lation functions of twist operators. Can we still represent the answer as a trace over a certain Hilbert space, i.e. Tr T n AB, where TAB is an analogue of the density matrix that can be defined when A and B are timelike separated regions? Note that A and B do not need to be the same size or related to each other in any particular way. To construct TAB for any system, not necessarily an RQFT, and to provide a useful perspective on it, re- call the relation between density matrices and correlation functions. A basic rule of quantum mechanics is that the expectation value of observable O in a state with density matrix \u03c1 is given by \u27e8O\u27e9= Tr(O\u03c1). (1) Suppose we bipartition our quantum system into a sub- system A and its complement A. We can represent an expectation value of an operator OA supported on A as the contraction (2) arXiv:2502.12240v1 [quant-ph] 17 Feb 2025"

    "abstract": "In a previous paper, the authors showed that two kinds of p-adic Siegel\u2013 Eisenstein series of degree n coincide with classical modular forms of weight k for \u03930(p), under the assumption that p is a regular prime. The purpose of this paper is to show that this condition on p can be removed if the degree n is low compared with k, namely, n \u22642k + 1. 1 Introduction Nagaoka [8] and Katsurada\u2013Nagaoka [6] considered p-adic limits of Siegel Eisenstein series for arbitrary degree n, starting from \u201cinitial weight\u201d k being 1 and 2 respec- tively. They showed that these limits become classical Siegel modular forms for \u03930(p), more precisely they were identi\ufb01ed with certain linear combinations of genus theta series. It was later noticed [7] that in their work a condition \u201cp regular\u201d had to be imposed if n is large, but the result remained valid unconditionally for small n. Using a di\ufb00erent technique (mod pm singular modular forms and their structure) we recently proved such a result for arbitrary k for regular primes p. We emphasize that this condition on p was needed for all n (including the case of small n). The purpose of the present note is to show that by using some ingredients from [3, 2] (but not the full strength of the structure theorem there) we can also get rid of the p-regularity condition if n is not too large compared with k (i.e., n \u22642k + 1). 1"
