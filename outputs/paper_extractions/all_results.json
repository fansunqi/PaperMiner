    "title": "The Longest Queue Drop Policy for Shared-Memory Switches is\n  1.5-competitive",
    "abstract": "  We consider the Longest Queue Drop memory management policy in shared-memory switches consisting of $N$ output ports. The shared memory of size $M\\geq N$ may have an arbitrary number of input ports. Each packet may be admitted by any incoming port, but must be destined to a specific output port and each output port may be used by only one queue. The Longest Queue Drop policy is a natural online strategy used in directing the packet flow in buffering problems. According to this policy and assuming unit packet values and cost of transmission, every incoming packet is accepted, whereas if the shared memory becomes full, one or more packets belonging to the longest queue are preempted, in order to make space for the newly arrived packets. It was proved in 2001 [Hahne et al., SPAA '01] that the Longest Queue Drop policy is 2-competitive and at least $\\sqrt{2}$-competitive. It remained an open question whether a (2-\\epsilon) upper bound for the competitive ratio of this policy could be shown, for any positive constant \\epsilon. We show that the Longest Queue Drop online policy is 1.5-competitive. "

    "abstract": "  We first show that given a $k_1$-letter quantum finite automata $\\mathcal{A}_1$ and a $k_2$-letter quantum finite automata $\\mathcal{A}_2$ over the same input alphabet $\\Sigma$, they are equivalent if and only if they are $(n_1^2+n_2^2-1)|\\Sigma|^{k-1}+k$-equivalent where $n_1$, $i=1,2$, are the numbers of state in $\\mathcal{A}_i$ respectively, and $k=\\max\\{k_1,k_2\\}$. By applying a method, due to the author, used to deal with the equivalence problem of {\\it measure many one-way quantum finite automata}, we also show that a $k_1$-letter measure many quantum finite automaton $\\mathcal{A}_1$ and a $k_2$-letter measure many quantum finite automaton $\\mathcal{A}_2$ are equivalent if and only if they are $(n_1^2+n_2^2-1)|\\Sigma|^{k-1}+k$-equivalent where $n_i$, $i=1,2$, are the numbers of state in $\\mathcal{A}_i$ respectively, and $k=\\max\\{k_1,k_2\\}$.   Next, we study the language equivalence problem of those two kinds of quantum finite automata. We show that for $k$-letter quantum finite automata, the non-strict cut-point language equivalence problem is undecidable, i.e., it is undecidable whether $L_{\\geq\\lambda}(\\mathcal{A}_1)=L_{\\geq\\lambda}(\\mathcal{A}_2)$ where $0<\\lambda\\leq 1$ and $\\mathcal{A}_i$ are $k_i$-letter quantum finite automata. Further, we show that both strict and non-strict cut-point language equivalence problem for $k$-letter measure many quantum finite automata are undecidable. The direct consequences of the above outcomes are summarized in the paper.   Finally, we comment on existing proofs about the minimization problem of one way quantum finite automata not only because we have been showing great interest in this kind of problem, which is very important in classical automata theory, but also due to that the problem itself, personally, is a challenge. This problem actually remains open. "

    "abstract": "  Contemporary collective action, much of which involves social media and other Internet-based platforms, leaves a digital imprint which may be harvested to better understand the dynamics of mobilization. Petition signing is an example of collective action which has gained in popularity with rising use of social media and provides such data for the whole population of petition signatories for a given platform. This paper tracks the growth curves of all 20,000 petitions to the UK government petitions website (http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk) and 1,800 petitions to the US White House site (https://petitions.whitehouse.gov), analyzing the rate of growth and outreach mechanism. Previous research has suggested the importance of the first day to the ultimate success of a petition, but has not examined early growth within that day, made possible here through hourly resolution in the data. The analysis shows that the vast majority of petitions do not achieve any measure of success; over 99 percent fail to get the 10,000 signatures required for an official response and only 0.1 percent attain the 100,000 required for a parliamentary debate (0.7 percent in the US). We analyze the data through a multiplicative process model framework to explain the heterogeneous growth of signatures at the population level. We define and measure an average outreach factor for petitions and show that it decays very fast (reducing to 0.1 pervent after 10 hours in the UK and 30 hours in the US). After a day or two, a petition's fate is virtually set. The findings challenge conventional analyses of collective action from economics and political science, where the production function has been assumed to follow an S-shaped curve. "

    "abstract": "  Differential privacy is a definition of \"privacy'\" for algorithms that analyze and publish information about statistical databases. It is often claimed that differential privacy provides guarantees against adversaries with arbitrary side information. In this paper, we provide a precise formulation of these guarantees in terms of the inferences drawn by a Bayesian adversary. We show that this formulation is satisfied by both \"vanilla\" differential privacy as well as a relaxation known as (epsilon,delta)-differential privacy. Our formulation follows the ideas originally due to Dwork and McSherry [Dwork 2006]. This paper is, to our knowledge, the first place such a formulation appears explicitly. The analysis of the relaxed definition is new to this paper, and provides some concrete guidance for setting parameters when using (epsilon,delta)-differential privacy. "

But due to the additivity of quantum mutual information under tensor product, the data processing inequality gives no bound when the parties are provided with arbitrary number of copies of the resource state. In this paper we introduce a measure of correlation on bipartite quantum states, called maximal correlation, that is not additive and gives the same number when computed for multiple copies. Then by proving a data processing inequality for this measure, we find a bound on the set of states that can be generated under local operations even when an arbitrary number of copies of the resource state is available.

Both expert-rating and decision-theoretic metrics are used to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the inference methods. "

    "abstract": "  AdaBoost is one of the most popular ML algorithms. It is simple to implement and often found very effective by practitioners, while still being mathematically elegant and theoretically sound. AdaBoost's interesting behavior in practice still puzzles the ML community. We address the algorithm's stability and establish multiple convergence properties of \"Optimal AdaBoost,\" a term coined by Rudin, Daubechies, and Schapire in 2004. We prove, in a reasonably strong computational sense, the almost universal existence of time averages, and with that, the convergence of the classifier itself, its generalization error, and its resulting margins, among many other objects, for fixed data sets under arguably reasonable conditions. Specifically, we frame Optimal AdaBoost as a dynamical system and, employing tools from ergodic theory, prove that, under a condition that Optimal AdaBoost does not have ties for best weak classifier eventually, a condition for which we provide empirical evidence from high dimensional real-world datasets, the algorithm's update behaves like a continuous map. We provide constructive proofs of several arbitrarily accurate approximations of Optimal AdaBoost; prove that they exhibit certain cycling behavior in finite time, and that the resulting dynamical system is ergodic; and establish sufficient conditions for the same to hold for the actual Optimal-AdaBoost update. We believe that our results provide reasonably strong evidence for the affirmative answer to two open conjectures, at least from a broad computational-theory perspective: AdaBoost always cycles and is an ergodic dynamical system. We present empirical evidence that cycles are hard to detect while time averages stabilize quickly. Our results ground future convergence-rate analysis and may help optimize generalization ability and alleviate a practitioner's burden of deciding how long to run the algorithm. "
